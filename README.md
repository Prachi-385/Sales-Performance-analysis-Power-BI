  # 3. Dashboard Development

The dashboard was designed to provide a clear, interactive, and business-focused view of Superstore’s sales and profit performance. Each visual was selected to communicate specific insights in a simple and intuitive way.

# Visuals Used & Their Purpose

1) Bar Charts
   - Used to compare Sales and Profit across Categories, Sub-Categories, and Customer Segments.
   - Helps identify which areas contribute most to revenue and which require attention.

2) Line Charts
    - Used for Yearly and Monthly Sales Trends.
    - These visuals help in understanding seasonality, growth patterns, and identifying peak sales periods.

3) Maps (Filled Map / Shape Map)
    - Used to show Sales and Profit by State/Region.
    - This helps identify geographical strengths, weak-performing states, and regions with potential growth.

4) KPI Cards
    - Displayed total Sales, total Profit, total Orders, and other key metrics.
    - These give a quick overview of the business performance at a glance.

5) Donut / Pie Charts
   - Used for Segment and Category-level distribution.
   - Helps to quickly understand the proportion of each segment/category in total sales.

6) Slicers (Filters)
   - Added for fields like Region, Category, Segment, Ship Mode, and Date Range.
   - Slicers make the dashboard interactive, allowing users to filter and explore data for specific business questions.
